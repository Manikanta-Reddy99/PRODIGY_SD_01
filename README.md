# PRODIGY_SD_01
# Temperature Conversion Program
 This project demonstrates a basic Temperature conversion program built with Java Concepts. it is designed to convert temperatures between different units: Celsius, 
 Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user inputs a temperature value along with the current unit, and the program converts it to the desired target unit. The program uses 
 basic mathematical formulas to perform the conversions and ensures accuracy in the results.
# Features
# Convert Between Celsius and Fahrenheit:
Allows the user to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Provides conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius as well.
# Convert Between Celsius and Kelvin:
Facilitates temperature conversion from Celsius to Kelvin.

Supports Kelvin to Celsius conversions.
# Convert Between Fahrenheit and Kelvin:
Allows conversions between Fahrenheit and Kelvin temperatures in both directions.
# User Input Validation:
Ensures that the user inputs valid numeric values for temperature.

Displays appropriate error messages for invalid input, such as non-numeric values.
